# VMOS
Victory Mobile Operating System 

## What is this?
VMOS (based off of FRC 971's AOS) is a mobile/embedded system that allows for the quick development and expirmentation of robotic platforms
and algortithms. With a focus on modularity, it has become my primary learning platform for embedded robotic development.
